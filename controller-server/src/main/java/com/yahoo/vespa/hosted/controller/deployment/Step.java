/**
 * Steps that make up a deployment job. See {@link JobProfile} for preset profiles.
 *
 * Each step lists its prerequisites; this serves two purposes:
 *
 *   1. A step may only run after its prerequisites, so these define a topological order in which
 *      the steps can be run. Since a job profile may list only a subset of the existing steps,
 *      only the prerequisites of a step which are included in a run's profile will be considered.
 *      Under normal circumstances, a step will run only after each of its prerequisites have succeeded.
 *      When a run has failed, however, each of the always-run steps of the run's profile will be run,
 *      again in a topological order, and requiring all their always-run prerequisites to have run.
 *
 *   2. A step will never run concurrently with its prerequisites. This is to ensure, e.g., that relevant
 *      information from a failed run is stored, and that deployment does not occur after deactivation.
